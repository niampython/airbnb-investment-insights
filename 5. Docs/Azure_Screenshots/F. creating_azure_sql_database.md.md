Creating and Connecting to an Azure SQL Database

This document outlines the full process of creating an Azure SQL Database, configuring firewall rules, enabling SQL Server authentication, and connecting to it using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

🧱 1. Create an Azure SQL Database
Step 1.1 — Go to Azure Portal

Navigate to https://portal.azure.com

Sign in with your Azure credentials.

Step 1.2 — Create a New SQL Database

In the search bar at the top, type “SQL Database”.

Click Create → SQL Database.

Fill out the required fields:

Subscription: Select your active subscription.

Resource group: Create a new one (e.g., DataEngineerProject1) or select an existing one.

Database name: Example — TouristCategoryDB.

Server: Click Create new.

⚙️ 2. Create a New SQL Server (Host for the Database)

When creating a new server:

Enter the following:

Server name: Example — touristcategoryserver.

Server admin login: Example — sqladminuser.

Password: Choose a secure password (save this for later).

Location: Select a region near you (e.g., Central US).

Click OK.

This creates both:

An Azure SQL Database (your actual data storage).

An Azure SQL Server (the logical host for your database).

🔐 3. Configure Firewall Rules to Allow Connections

By default, Azure SQL blocks all external connections.
You need to allow your local IP address or network to connect.

Step 3.1 — Go to Your SQL Server Resource

From the Azure Portal home, go to “SQL servers”.

Click the server you just created (e.g., touristcategoryserver).

Step 3.2 — Add a Firewall Rule

In the left menu, click Networking or Firewalls and virtual networks.

Under Firewall rules, click + Add client IP.

This automatically detects your current IP address and adds it.

Click Save at the top.

✅ Your local machine can now connect to the Azure SQL Server.

👤 4. Configure Authentication Method (SQL Authentication)

When you created the server, you set up a:

Server admin login name

Password

That’s SQL Server Authentication, which uses a username/password instead of Azure AD credentials.

You’ll use these credentials later in SSMS and in your ETL scripts.

💻 5. Connect to Azure SQL Database Using SSMS
Step 5.1 — Open SQL Server Management Studio

Open SSMS on your local machine.

Step 5.2 — Connect to Server

When the Connect to Server window appears:

Server type: Database Engine

Server name: <yourservername>.database.windows.net
Example:

touristcategoryserver.database.windows.net


Authentication: SQL Server Authentication

Login: Your admin username (e.g., sqladminuser)

Password: The password you created

💡 Tip: Check “Remember password” if you connect frequently.

Step 5.3 — Connection Properties (Important!)

Click Options >>

Go to the Connection Properties tab.

Under Connect to database, type your actual database name (e.g., TouristCategoryDB).

Click Connect.

✅ You should now be connected to your Azure SQL Database successfully.

🧩 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue	Cause	Solution
🔒 Cannot connect / Timeout	Firewall not allowing your IP	Go back to your Azure SQL Server → Networking → Add client IP
❌ Login failed for user	Wrong authentication type	Ensure you’re using SQL Server Authentication (not Windows or Azure AD)
⚠️ Connected to master database	Forgot to specify target DB	In SSMS “Connection Properties” → enter database name manually
🔄 ETL script not connecting	Outbound IP not allowed	Add your VM or script host IP to the Azure SQL firewall rules
